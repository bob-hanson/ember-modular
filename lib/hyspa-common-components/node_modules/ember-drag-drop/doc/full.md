# Primitives

## Draggable Object

The `draggable-object` component represents an object you want to drag onto a target.

The two things to provide to the component are:

* The model - Represents the object to be dragged. Will be passed to the target after a completed drag.
* The template code to render for the draggable object

```handlebars
{{#draggable-object model=this}}
  {{name}}
{{/draggable-object}}
```

--------------

## Draggable Object Target

The `draggable-object-target` represents a place to drag objects. This will trigger an action which accepts the dragged object as an argument.

The two things to provide to the component are:

* The action - Represents the action to be called with the dragged object.
* The template code to render for the target.

The action is called with two arguments:

* The dragged object.
* An options hash. Currently the only key is `target`, which is the draggable-object-target component. 

```handlebars
... your regular template code

{{#draggable-object-target action="increaseRating" amount="5"}}
  Drag here to increase rating
{{/draggable-object-target}}
```

```javascript
// represents the controller backing the above template

Ember.Controller.extend({
  // your regular controller code

  actions: {
    increaseRating: function(obj,ops) {
      var amount = parseInt(ops.target.amount);
      obj.incrementProperty("rating",amount);
      obj.save();
    }
  }
}
});
```

# Examples

## Classify Posts

In this example, we have a bunch of unclassified posts that we want to mark either Ready to Publish or Needs Revision.

When you drag a post onto one of the Possible Statuses, it will be:

* Assigned that rating.
* Removed from the Unclassified Posts list, by virtue of now having a status.

app/models/post.js

```javascript
export default DS.Model.extend({
  title: DS.attr('string'),
  body: DS.attr('string'),
  status: DS.attr('string')
});
```

app/controllers/posts.js

```javascript
export default Ember.ArrayController.extend({
  unclassifiedPosts: Ember.computed.filterBy('content', 'status', undefined),

  actions: {
    setStatus: function(post,ops) {
      var status = ops.target.status;
      post.set("status",status);
      post.save();
    }
  }
}
});
```

app/templates/posts.hbs

```handlebars
<h3>Unclassified Posts</h3>
{{#each post in unclassifiedPosts}}
  {{#draggable-object model=post}}
    {{post.title}}
  {{/draggable-object}}
{{/each}}

<h3>Possible Statuses</h3>
{{#draggable-object-target action="setStatus" status="Ready to Publish"}}
  Ready to Publish
{{/draggable-object-target}}

{{#draggable-object-target action="setStatus" status="Needs Revision"}}
  Needs Revision
{{/draggable-object-target}}
```
